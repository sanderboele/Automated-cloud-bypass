This program was written by Sander Boele (sanderb@ NO SPAM sara.nl) for the GEANT3 project, task 2
It captures traffic from an interface and counts bytes to certain networks that are defined in settings.rb.
It has been tested with a port mirror on a switch to a free interface on a computer.
To create a settings.rb file, copy the file from settings_example.rb and fill in your settings.
If the thresholds in settings.rb are met, the script sets up a lightpath or dynamic circuit to a predetermined destination.
Run it as root for the interface to go into promiscuous mode and the script to work
The easiest way to use it, is in a GNU Screen. The script logs in /var/log/messages.

In order to avoid the log to be filled up with messages like these:
Mar 25 21:52:58 stampertje kernel: [3914962.179734] device eth1 left promiscuous mode
Mar 25 21:52:59 stampertje kernel: [3914963.020017] device eth1 entered promiscuous mode

You can put the device in parmanent promiscuous mode with 

ifconfig et1 promisc

This program requires a ruby interpreter and some other stuff:

ruby 1.8.7
